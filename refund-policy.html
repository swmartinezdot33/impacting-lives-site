          <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
          <p class="section-intro">
            This Refund Policy applies to professional services, wellness memberships, and related
            fees billed by Impacting Lives LLC. It is intended to satisfy the transparency
            requirements of payment processors and communications partners while clearly explaining
            what portions of your charges may or may not be refundable.
          </p>

          <section class="policy-block">
            <h2>1. General Principles</h2>
            <p>
              Impacting Lives LLC provides professional medical services, clinical consultations,
              and wellness programs. Fees are generally categorized as
              <strong>lab fees</strong>, <strong>consultation/professional fees</strong>, and
              <strong>membership or program fees</strong>. Because these services involve
              clinician time, third-party laboratories, and pharmacies, not all charges are
              refundable.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="policy-block">
            <h2>2. Laboratory Fees</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Laboratory testing may be billed directly by the outside laboratory or passed
                through Impacting Lives LLC. Once a lab order has been processed or a specimen has
                been collected, associated <strong>lab fees are generally non-refundable</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a lab order is cancelled <strong>before</strong> it is processed by the
                laboratory, we will work with the lab to determine whether a credit or refund is
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any refund for lab fees is subject to the policies of the specific laboratory
                involved.

            <h2>3. Consultation & Professional Fees</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Consultation fees cover clinician review of your chart and labs, the telehealth
                visit itself, and care planning.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you cancel at least <strong>24 hours</strong> prior to the scheduled
                appointment, consultation charges are ordinarily
                <strong>eligible for refund or not billed</strong>, depending on the payment
                status at the time of cancellation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Missed appointments or cancellations with less than 24 hours’ notice may be
                charged in full or subject to a no-show fee and are
                <strong>generally not refundable</strong>.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Some services are offered through recurring memberships or wellness programs that
                include bundled access to consultations, monitoring, and support.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may cancel a recurring membership at any time as described in our

              </li>
              <li>
                Charges already incurred for the current billing period
                <strong>are generally not refundable</strong>, as program resources and clinician
                availability have been allocated for that period.
              </li>
              <li>
                In limited circumstances (for example, a documented billing error), we may issue a
                partial or full refund at our discretion.

            <h2>5. Medications & Pharmacy Charges</h2>
            <p>
              Medications are dispensed by independent, licensed pharmacies. Pharmacy charges
              (including medication and shipping) are governed by the policies of those
              pharmacies and are <strong>not controlled by Impacting Lives LLC</strong>. As a
              result:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Questions or disputes about medication or shipping charges should be directed to
                the dispensing pharmacy.
              </li>
              <li>
                We cannot typically refund pharmacy or shipping charges on behalf of the pharmacy.
