              Impacting Lives LLC provides professional medical services, including clinical
              consultations and care coordination. Fees may be separated into components such as
              lab fees, consultation fees, and ongoing wellness subscription charges.
            </p>
            <h3>Lab Fees</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Laboratory testing may be billed either directly by the outside laboratory or
                through Impacting Lives LLC, depending on the arrangement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once a lab order has been processed or sample collection has occurred, associated
                <strong>lab fees are generally non-refundable</strong>, even if you decide not to
                proceed with further care.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a lab order was placed in error or cancelled before processing, we will work
                with the laboratory to determine if a credit or refund is available.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Consultation & Professional Fees</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Initial and follow-up consultation fees cover the time and expertise of the
                clinician, chart review, and care planning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consultation fees are <strong>refundable if you cancel</strong> at least
                24 hours in advance of the scheduled appointment time, unless otherwise specified
                in writing.

          <section id="cancellation-policy" class="policy-block">
            <h2>Cancellation Policy for Recurring Wellness Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>
              Some patients may enroll in recurring wellness or membership plans that include
              bundled services (such as periodic consultations, monitoring, and program support).
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You may cancel a recurring wellness subscription by contacting us via the Patient
                Portal, emailing
                <a href="mailto:hello@impacthealthclinics.com">hello@impacthealthclinics.com</a>, or
                calling <a href="tel:+16624047177">(662) 404-7177</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Please provide at least <strong>7 days’ notice</strong> prior to your next billing
                date to avoid being charged for the upcoming cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cancellation is effective at the end of the current billing period unless otherwise
                specified in your service agreement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fees already incurred for services delivered during the current billing cycle are
                generally non-refundable.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After cancellation, you may lose access to certain member resources or program
              benefits associated with your subscription. Any outstanding clinical follow-up should
              be discussed directly with your clinician.

          <!-- SHIPPING POLICY -->
          <section id="shipping-policy" class="policy-block">
            <h2>Shipping Policy for Medications</h2>
            <p>
              Impacting Lives LLC does not operate its own pharmacy. When clinically appropriate,
              prescriptions are sent to third-party, licensed pharmacies for fulfillment.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Prescription Fulfillment</strong>: Medications are dispensed and shipped
                by independent, licensed pharmacies that may be selected by the patient or the
                prescribing clinician, subject to state law and payer requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shipping Method</strong>: Pharmacies typically ship medications via
                common carriers (for example, UPS, FedEx, USPS, or other
                <span class="placeholder">[Carrier]</span>) with appropriate packaging and, when
                needed, temperature controls.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shipping Fees & Timeframes</strong>: Shipping costs, delivery times, and
                tracking information are determined by the dispensing pharmacy and/or carrier,
                not by Impacting Lives LLC.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lost or Damaged Shipments</strong>: Issues related to lost, stolen, or
                damaged shipments should be promptly reported to the pharmacy and the carrier in
                accordance with their policies. We can assist with documentation as needed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For questions about a specific shipment, please reference the pharmacy contact
              information provided on your prescription label or medication documentation.
