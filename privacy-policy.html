          <p class="section-intro">
            This Privacy Policy explains how Impacting Lives LLC (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects,
            uses, and protects information when you use our website and communication channels. It
            is intended to help satisfy transparency requirements of payment and communications
            vendors, including but not limited to Stripe, GoHighLevel, and Twilio.
          </p>

          <section class="policy-block">
            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through our public website and
              non-clinical communications (for example, general email or SMS alerts). Protected
              Health Information (PHI) associated with your medical care is handled through secure,
              HIPAA-supporting systems such as our electronic health record (EHR) and patient
              portal, and is governed by our
              <a href="policies.html#hipaa-notice">HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices</a>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="policy-block">
            <h2>2. Information We May Collect</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage and device data</strong>: IP address, browser type, operating system,
                pages viewed, and time spent on pages.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Basic contact information</strong>: If you contact us by phone or email, we
                may receive your name, email address, phone number, and the content of your
                message.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Communications metadata</strong>: When we send permitted notifications or
                updates by SMS, voice, or email, we may collect delivery and engagement data (for
                example, whether a message was delivered or opened).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We ask that you avoid sending detailed medical or highly sensitive information by
              regular email or SMS; instead, use the Patient Portal for protected health
              communications.

            </ul>
            <p>
